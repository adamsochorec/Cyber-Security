            <br />Wednesday the 31st of August, I spent mostly with Andreas. He
            came to visit me in my student flat on Palosaarentie, to help me
            with my website‚Äôs server. Before we deeply dived into the code
            troubleshooting, I cooked a giant portion of the most budget meat
            you can get in Finland - chicken legs, 3 EUR for a whole Kg. While I
            was cooking we had one of the conversations I usually have with Juan
            in Denmark. Philosophical life motivation one. I was half busy
            keeping an eye on the meat with vegetables and rice and half having
            a deep conversation. The outcomes of both activities were pretty all
            right. When was the dish done and served, both of us opened a can of
            diet-flavoured cola and started eating. We haven‚Äôt stopped in
            conversations and often stopped during lunch when one of us wanted
            to explain something. Afterwards, we fixed my the problem with the
            PHP script running on my website and happily went to the gym. After
            two to three hours of gym, we allowed ourselves to relax on awesome
            massage chairs in the gym. Andreas and I were pretty tired, so I
            proposed we could use the sauna I had in my dormitory basement. Bad
            trip in Bulwark I and Emil have travelled Emil‚Äôs old stolen
            Woltsvagen and Jokie, Tommy with Andreas took Tommy‚Äôs Passat. Along
            the off-road path through the forest, we passed two hunter‚Äôs cars,
            which were signs we aren‚Äôt going to be the only ones in the bush.
            When both groups arrived at the end of the road, we took our
            backpacks and together with Emil‚Äôs dog headed straight to the woods.
            As for most of the time, the majority of conversations were in
            Swedish - I was the only foreigner. I believe that guys the guys
            sensed I understand scraps of their chats, and I made them later
            sure I do, my guess is about 40%. However, it wasn‚Äôt rare I felt
            quite isolated and anxious. One of the depressions came up to me on
            the way to our future camp in the mire. The boys were having quite
            fun along the way and discussing which way is the best to avoid the
            uncertain swampy land around the mire and throwing dirt on the
            hunters. I was left out and I could not leave them because I didn‚Äôt
            know a shit where to go. I stayed close to the group but remained
            silent. We stopped at a peak of a narrow peninsula surrounded by
            swamp mire and further by forrest. The decision to build a camp
            there has been made and everyone started executing some tasks that
            have to be done - collecting branches and firewood, erecting ropes
            and tarps or sparking a fire. I was just at a peak of a shock wave
            of loneliness and frustration from not being able to properly fit
            into any kind of society when those essential tasks had to be done
            in order to start chilling, smoking and tripping. I decided to not
            participate, as usually I was planning to sleep in a bivak under the
            holy sky and the food I had were mostly canned goods - fuck their
            fire and tarp tents. For a few minutes I was playing with Barbarian,
            Emil‚Äôs husky and afterwards I found myself a soft spot out of camp
            and tried to fall asleep. Did not work, one of my common day-lasting
            headache attacks got me, so I was at least trying to relax and enjoy
            being alone. When I decided I cold and bored from pretending to
            sleep, I returned to the plain where I found myself surprised was
            build cosy bushcraft camp - spaces between the trees were filled out
            either by Emil‚Äôs hammock and Joakim‚Äôs and Tommy‚Äôs tarp shelters in a
            circle with a burning camp-fire in the middle. I positively answered
            Tommy that I was indeed taking a nap and because I wasn‚Äôt really
            feeling any better than before the ‚Äúnap‚Äù I took an ibalgin. It did
            not take long weather to break my plan simple sleeping strategy when
            started to rain. When Joakim offered me to split space bellow his
            tarp for both of us, I didn‚Äôt refuse. So it was raining, moss was
            soaking like a sponge and we were seeking dry comfort in the
            shelters. The first decision I later regret was taking a sparked
            joint, not once, not twice, not even a three times. I knew it‚Äôs the
            worst thing I can do in order to get rid of my pain but I just did
            it, hoping it would just work the other way‚Ä¶ Second bad decision was
            eating an undentified amount of liberty caps. If you ever thought
            that if you‚Äôre having a bad day and taking a shrooms will somehow
            reverse it, you‚Äôre fucking wrong. It works exactly the other way
            around, eventually pushes your shitty mood into psychosis. Like it
            happened to me.
