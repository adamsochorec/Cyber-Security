# Cyber-security
"Project background
Consumers are more Internet-connected than ever before: each household owns, on average,
more than 10 Internet-connected devices.

Cybersecurity is the protection of Internet-connected systems against cyber threats. It is important
because it protects sensitive data against theft and misuse. Personal data includes e.g., personally
identifiable information (PII), health information, etc.

The use of passwords is a standard way to authenticate access to digital services and systems, but
when it comes to the formation and storage of these passwords, many users exhibit an insecure
behavior – as an example, approx. 50% of all internet users use the same password for all their
digital services and systems, and approx. 35% choose convenience over security when faced with
having to create a new password.

But even with a strong password, one’s data is not necessarily secure. Another method that
cybercriminals use is phishing, which is a form of social engineering in which cybercriminals tricks
victims into disclosing sensitive information or installing malware. They do this by sending them a
fake email that seems legitimate. Emotions and a sense of urgency rushes the recipient of the
email to disclose personal information such as passwords or credit card information.

Passwords, social engineering, and phishing are just some of the keywords in this project where
the focus is on cybersecurity.

Key takeaways: Users are ultimately the weakest link in cybersecurity.

an element in cybersecurity to private Internet users?"
