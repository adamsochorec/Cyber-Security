        <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain
          this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable
          means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access,
          disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you
          provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or
          storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data
          security. We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any
          data breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall
          security strength, ensuring the security of your own information
          within the bounds of our services.
        </p>
        <h2>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This
          time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in
          accordance with this privacy policy. If your personal information is
          no longer required, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing
          all details that identify you.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our
          compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for
          archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical
          research purposes or statistical purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children
          under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
          information about children under 13.
        </p>
        <h2>International Transfers of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          The personal information we collect is stored and/or processed where
          we or our partners, affiliates, and third-party providers maintain
          facilities. Please be aware that the locations to which we store,
          process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same
          data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided
          the information. If we transfer your personal information to third
          parties in other countries: (i) we will perform those transfers in
          accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) we will
          protect the transferred personal information in accordance with this
          privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          You always retain the right to withhold personal information from us,
          with the understanding that your experience of our website may be
          affected. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
          your rights over your personal information. If you do provide us with
          personal information you understand that we will collect, hold, use
          and disclose it in accordance with this privacy policy. You retain the
          right to request details of any personal information we hold about
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we receive personal information about you from a third party, we
          will protect it as set out in this privacy policy. If you are a third
          party providing personal information about somebody else, you
          represent and warrant that you have such person’s consent to provide
          the personal information to us.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information
          for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time.
          We will provide you with the ability to unsubscribe from our
          email-database or opt out of communications. Please be aware we may
          need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate,
          out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, please contact us
          using the details provided in this privacy policy. We will take
          reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate,
          incomplete, misleading, or out of date.

          and wish to make a complaint, please contact us using the details
          below and provide us with full details of the alleged breach. We will
          promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing,

          take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a
