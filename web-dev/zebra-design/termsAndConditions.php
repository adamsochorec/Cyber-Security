          written approval:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Government agencies;</li>
          <li>Search engines;</li>
          <li>News organizations;</li>
          <li>
            Online directory distributors may link to our Website in the same
            manner as they hyperlink to the Websites of other listed businesses;
            and
          </li>
          <li>
            System-wide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit
            organizations, charity shopping malls, and charity fundraising
            groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These organizations may link to our home page, to publications, or to
          other Website information so long as the link: (a) is not in any way
          deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement, or
          approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and
          (c) fits within the context of the linking party's site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may consider and approve other link requests from the following
          types of organizations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>commonly-known consumer and/or business information sources;</li>

          <li>educational institutions and trade associations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will approve link requests from these organizations if we decide
          that: (a) the link would not make us look unfavorably to ourselves or
          to our accredited businesses; (b) the organization does not have any
          negative records with us; (c) the benefit to us from the visibility of
          the hyperlink compensates the absence of Zebra Design; and (d) the
          link is in the context of general resource information.
        </p>
        <p>
          These organizations may link to our home page so long as the link: (a)
          is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship,
          endorsement, or approval of the linking party and its products or
          services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's site.

          organization name, contact information as well as the URL of your

        <ul>
          <li>By use of our corporate name; or</li>
          <li>By use of the uniform resource locator being linked to; or</li>
          <li>
            Using any other description of our Website being linked to that
            makes sense within the context and format of content on the linking
            party's site.
          </li>
        </ul>
