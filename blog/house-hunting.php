          Inspiration for the concept of <i>House Hunting</i> I originally
          borrowed from inspiring photographer and artist

          My the goal was to merge urbex, my fascination of adorable
          Scandinavian architecture, the concept of

          the project as well as Hido's narrative way of calling things from the
          past by capturing their current state or left marks.

        <p class="reveal">
          In a past, I tried several times to apply the inspiration I gained
          from Hiddo's works to lonely constructions in Czechia and Denmark.
          Even though the exterior atmosphere was slightly more matching to the
          one that Hido works with - lonely lights, night, and fog often
          captured trough long exposure on a medium format camera, I felt that
          this time I was the closest to Hido's world.

          During one of my walks in the neighbourhood of Palosaari, I couldn't
          unnoticed the beautiful pale green colour of low-key old-fashioned
          family house. After closer inspection, I noticed broken windows and
          entrance stairs, so I was quite sure the building is uninhabited. The
          building immediately triggered my photographer's instinct. I saw an
          opportunity to play around and implement some new elements into
          something I've been already working with. Tempting, I thought.

          Beforehand I established communication with a department of city
          planning, to gain some insight into the property. We figured out that
          the building is marked as a demolition project, so my initial the idea
          to take photos that could be used by
          <b>Cheap Old Houses</b> initiative to sell and save this building
          sank.<br /><br />Notherless there is a chance to have faith into local
          authorities:<br />

              ...based on the age and possible historical value the The

          When a property owner's permission to take a look inside the building
