            An expedition to Ã…land Islands was on my mind since my first days in
            Finland. Its time came in mid-October 2022, during Autumn break. My
            friend from Swedish Dalarna and I have decided to take a ferry from
            the Finnish coastal town Turku (Ã…bo) in the early morning. Train
            connections from our hometown Vaasa were not matching in the early
            hours, so we had to stay in Turku overnight. We planned to sleep in
            the Alandâ€™s forest the entire upcoming week, so we decided to
            conduct our one-night stand in Turku in a similar spirit and we
            slept on the wall of the Turku castle, below the main tower. Slight
            rain in the early morning forced us to move to the port earlier than
            we planned but at least we were protected against the rain.

            As soon as the onboarding started, new issues a raised. A security a
            guard spotted my belt carrying a leatherman multitool and a larger
            the outdoor knife I carry while in the wilderness. His English was
            lacking, but with Andreaseâ€™s Swedish help we were able to figure out
            he wants to perform a luggage check and take our knives during the
            cruise. Fortunately, the conflict was soon resolved we were allowed
            to board in, settle and get some more rest during the following
            four-hour travel.<br />
            For the first two or three hours, our cruise was moreover a slalom
            between hundreds of archipelagos as we were sailing through the the
            densest area of the Archipelago sea. Approximately 50 000
            archipelagos and tiny rocky islands (rarely with some green wood as
            well) are accommodated in the Archipelago sea, the area between
            Turku and Ã…land Islands. This moderate space of the size of 8300
            square kilometres is considered one of the largest by the number of
            archipelagos in the world. And it is truly an interesting scenery to
            look at.<br /><br />After onboarding from our Baltic princess in
            Mariehamn, we met with our third adventure seeker, Slovak Marcel.<br />
            When we resupplied our groceries and liquids in Ã…landâ€™s capital and
            the largest city, we started our discovery journey, from south to
            north.<br /><br /><i>
              There is one rule of thumb I always try to follow when performing
              a hike or cycle for an extended time, and that is to take a short
              break every 45-60 minutes, stretch, eat some sugar or protein and
              get some water. Besides actual relaxation, setting up this reward
              the regime, for your brain, in a consistent time frame as well as
              slicing the large piece into several shorter ones increases your
              long-time performance and motivation to continue.</i
            ><br /><br />Around midnight we decided to 25 km with heavy
            backpacks are enough for our first day of the expedition. Overnight
            camp has been built nearby the city Godby (a good town) on the bank
            of the lake LÃ¥ngsjÃ¶n, the habitat of a crayfish.

          <p>
            The following morning we figured out that the local ferry, we weâ€™re
            supposed to take back from the north tip of the islands is working
            only over the summer. This information was quite unexpected and it
            forced us to change our discovery strategy. Our original plan, to
            walk over 100km in five days, from south to north through the
            eastern hemisphere of the most habitat island Fasta and get back
            over the western hemisphere was transformed into hitchhiking and
            seeing as much as possible. <br />We resupplied and according to the
            the original plan and headed out of the city towards the caves up
            north.<br />Our modest adventure team managed to get to reach
            Djupviksgrottan cave by the evening of our second day with two
            hitch-hiking transitions. Thanks to the brave female Ã…landers that
            were not hesitant to take three strange pilgrims with large
            backpacks, and hiking poles made out of tree branches into their
            empty car.<br />Luckily, because of Andreasâ€™s origin, we were able
            to communicate our route intentions despite the frequent lack of
            English among the locals.

          <p>
            For clarification, Ã…land Islands are autonomously demilitarised
            territories under Finnish jurisdiction. They have their government,
            flag, and historical heritage and unlike male Finns, are free of
            military service. Despite the bilingual western shore of the
            mainland (Swedish and Finnish), Ã…land Islands are entirely Swedish
            speaking.<br /><br />
            After we said
            <i>"Tack sÃ¥ mycket och har det bra! (Big thanks and take care)"</i>
            to our last ferryman, we started descending from a rocky hill
            towards the nearby seashore. Vegetation closer to the sea was
            slightly different from inland. Forests covering the surrounding red
            granite hills were thin and mainly consisted of pines and birches,
            which were in general shorter.<br />
            Another common vegetation in clusters covering bare rocks was moss
            and blubbery ferns.

          <p>
            Along with the sunset and moderate rain, we overcame several
            remaining kilometres of dusty road to collect the least wet wood,
            made a fire, and hid in the cave.<br />Our evening was about drying
            our wet clothes in a slightly less wet cave and over the fire
            rocking about a raw testimonial from the 19th century from the
            Russian occupation era which was written down on a nearby info
            desk.<br /><br />
            On our second morning in Finnish autonomous territory, we have been
            woken up by early tourists looking up at the cave as well as its
            dreaming inhabitants.<br />Because we were running short of water we
            had to water our morning porridge with boiled water collected from
            surrounding rainwater pools. Over the porridge and strong tea made
            of earlier collected roses and fresh spruce needles, we discussed
            strategy for our upcoming day.

            Before leaving the cave, I and Marcel scouted our surrounding
            countryside, we were quite surprised when we discovered
            fancy-looking and well-equipped pairs of cottages just a few hundred
            meters above the cave, essentially in the middle of nowhere.

            Later on, that day we were again on our feet, walking on the red
            roads, that are just everywhere you go on Ã…lands, passing rural
            house settlements and farms seeking good souls with thumbs up once
            again.<br />This time our carriers consisted of two fresh-looking
            wanderers we talked with earlier that day in the cave (the only mans
            that stopped us over our entire journey!) Once again we were
            exchanging stories and tips with strangers in their cars, squeezed
            into the rear seats.<br />On strangerâ€™s way to the capital on the
            very south, our paths have split in Godby.<br />As for the first
            time, resupplied with groceries recharged our lithium, chilled in
            the lobby and reviewed our strategy.

          <p>
            It was just the second day of our expedition and we already reached
            our final destination, we decided to conquer the east of the
            archipelago territory as a plan for our remaining two days.<br />
            To pitty of our team, as soon as we finished our planning and got
            ready to continue, a violent storm with intense rain occurred.
            Despite fateâ€™s unwillingness, we proceeded further into darkness,
            far away from the city lights, thumbs up again.<br />After an hour
            of struggling to attract passing drivers with smiles and hand waves,
            when it seemed that Ã…landers are coldhearted, and without mercy to
            trespassing foreigners, Nissan seemed to unnoticed the presence of
            three pilgrims, far away from the city in heavy rain, pulled over a
            few dozen meters away. As soon as we realised what happened, we
            sprinted along with cheering.<br />Lonely driver called Karolina
            offered us hot tea with a promise of warming up in her nearby house.
            Later that evening we met most likely her entire family including
            cats, dogs and chickens.<br />Karolinas tribe made all of us
            wanderers feel as welcome as being back home and still being
            thousands of kilometres far away.

            <br />The original tea break has extended into a deep discussion and
            storytelling over dinner, with stoves heating our backs, with
            Karolina, the second head of the tribe, Thomas and their daughter
            Frida.<br />When Andreas, Marcel and me agreed upon our hosts being
            truly generous to strangers, we were offered a sleepover (bed!!) and
            keys from their car for the following day. We humbly accepted the
            given offerings and went to sleep like babies.<br /><br />Our third
            the day has begun with the sound of the familyâ€™s cock as well as
            with both homemade yoghurt and eggs.

          <p>
            Karolina advised us to scout the island PrÃ¤sto we were located on,
            which is among the local prominent due to accommodating several
            historical graveyards - Jewish, Muslim and Christian ones.<br />When
            we wandered around this truly spiritual archipelago and had a
            remarkable land view of our surroundings from a nearby tower and
            cuddled with a flock of curious sheep, we returned to our temporary
            basecamp to borrow a car and wander further east, over the red
            roads, which were from time to time replaced by car ferries, to the
            end of the road on VÃ¥rdÃ¶.

          respect and remembrance."

            Our afternoon was in the spirit of attempts to fish in the crystal
            clear water of an empty fishing village on the tip of VÃ¥rdÃ¶ and swim
            in the October cold Archipelago sea.<br />
            <br />Despite you could count the days we have spent together on the
            fingers of a single hand, when came time for goodbye to our hosts in
            the evening, it felt like leaving a good old friend after a long
            time of not seeing each other. <br /><br />However we did not get an
            opportunity to reward the generous family, I thought that they might
            be repaying an old debt to someone else. This idea makes me think
            that if I will provide for others, my debt to the universe will be
            repaid and someone else will have a reason to treat man generously.

            Our final task was to get reach back to Mariehamn. Without any luck
            with hitchhiking, after several hours of hiking through the empty
            red roads, we reached approximately 17km distant Godby in the night
            and erected a camp tarp on the bank of lake LÃ¥ngsjÃ¶n as a few days
            ago.<br /><br />The final day was in the spirit of reaching the
            final destination in the evening and spending the last evening in
            the forest between the city and the seashore.<br />Despite the
            feeling that we overcame all snares of fate, the final one was
            hiding above Mariehamn. Moderate but entire night-lasting rain did
            not give us very much sleep. Especially to poor Marcel, sleeping in
            under the bare sky just in a sleeping bag was one morning soaked as
            a sponge.<br />My semi-waterproof bivak bag protected me over most
            of the rain but a significant amount got inside as well. Andreas,
            who wisely built a modest tent out of his tarp, was probably the
            driest of us in the morning. <br />Unfortunately, the tarp tent did
            not cover his feet and because of its large open entrance, the rain
            did not avoid even the most farsighted of us.<br /><br />
            On the final morning, we compared the level of wetness each of us
            had and said goodbye.<br />Marcel travelled back to Denmark over
            Stockholm, me and Andreas back to Turku to Finland.
