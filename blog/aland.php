          An expedition to the Åland Islands had been on my mind since I arrived
          in Finland. In mid-October 2022, during the Autumn break, my friend
          from Swedish Dalarna and I decided to take a ferry from the Finnish
          coastal town of Turku (Åbo). We had to stay in Turku overnight because
          the train connections from our hometown of Vaasa did not match the
          early ferry departure time. As soon as the onboarding process began,
          we encountered some issues with security. A security guard spotted my
          belt, which was carrying a leatherman multitool and a larger outdoor
          knife that I like to carry while in the wilderness. His English was
          limited, but with the help of my friend Andrease's Swedish, we were
          able to understand that he wanted to perform a luggage check and take
          our knives during the cruise. Fortunately, the conflict was quickly
          resolved and we were allowed to board and settle in for the four-hour
          journey.

          For the first few hours, our cruise was mainly a slalom between
          hundreds of archipelagos as we sailed through the densest area of the
          Archipelago sea. This area, approximately 8300 square kilometers in
          size, is home to around 50,000 archipelagos and tiny rocky islands. It
          is considered one of the largest areas by the number of archipelagos
          in the world, and it is truly an interesting sight to behold.
          <br />
          After we disembarked from the Baltic princess in Mariehamn, the
          capital of the Åland Islands, we met with our third adventure seeker,
          Marcel from Slovakia. When we resupplied our groceries and liquids in
          Åland's capital and largest city, we started our journey of discovery
          from south to north. We followed a rule of thumb to take a short break
          every 45-60 minutes in order to stretch, eat some sugar or protein,
          and get some water. This helped us to maintain our performance and
          motivation over the long haul.

        <p>
          We had to change our plans when we learned that the local ferry we
          were supposed to take back from the north tip of the islands only
          operates during the summer. Our original plan to walk over 100km in
          five days, from south to north through the eastern hemisphere of the
          most inhabited island, Fasta, and return through the western
          hemisphere, was changed to hitchhiking and seeing as much as possible.
          We were able to reach the Djupviksgrottan cave by the evening of the
          second day with the help of two hitchhiking rides. The Åland Islands
          are autonomously demilitarized territories under Finnish jurisdiction.
          They have their own government, flag, and historical heritage and are
          exempt from military service. Although the western shore of the
          mainland is bilingual (Swedish and Finnish), the Åland Islands are
          entirely Swedish-speaking.

        <p>
          After saying goodbye to our last ferryman, we started our journey
          through the western part of the islands. We walked and hitchhiked
          along the coast, taking in the beautiful scenery and meeting friendly
          locals. We visited the lighthouse at the north tip of the islands,
          which was a highlight of the trip. On the way back, we stopped at the
          church in Jomala, where we saw the graves of sailors who died at sea.

        <p>
          Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and one that we highly
          recommend to anyone looking to explore this unique part of Finland.

        <p>
          Before leaving the cave, I and Marcel scouted our surrounding
          countryside, we were quite surprised when we discovered fancy-looking
          and well-equipped pairs of cottages just a few hundred meters above
          the cave, essentially in the middle of nowhere.

        <p>
          Later on, that day we were again on our feet, walking on the red
          roads, that are just everywhere you go on Ålands, passing rural house
          settlements and farms seeking good souls with thumbs up once again.<br />This
          The time our carriers consisted of two fresh-looking wanderers we
          talked with earlier that day in the cave (the only man that stopped us
          over our entire journey!) Once again we were exchanging stories and
          tips with strangers in their cars, squeezed into the rear seats.<br />On
          stranger’s way to the capital on the very south, our paths have split
          in Godby.<br />As for the first time, resupplied with groceries
          recharged our lithium, chilled in the lobby and reviewed our strategy.

        <p>
          It was just the second day of our expedition and we already reached
          our final destination, we decided to conquer the east of the
          archipelago territory as a plan for our remaining two days.<br />
          To the pitty of our team, as soon as we finished our planning and got
          ready to continue, a violent storm with intense rain occurred. Despite
          fate’s unwillingness, we proceeded further into darkness, far away
          from the city lights, thumbs up again.<br />After an hour of
          struggling to attract passing drivers with smiles and hand waves, when
          it seemed that Ålanders are coldhearted, and without mercy to
          trespassing foreigners, Nissan seemed to unnoticed the presence of
          three pilgrims, far away from the city in heavy rain, pulled over a
          few dozen meters away. As soon as we realised what happened, we
          sprinted along with cheering.<br />Lonely driver called Karolina
          offered us hot tea with a promise of warming up in her nearby house.
          Later that evening we met most likely her entire family including
          cats, dogs and chickens.<br />Karolinas tribe made all of us wanderers
          feel as welcome as being back home and still being thousands of
          kilometres far away.

        />
        <p>
          The original tea break has extended into a deep discussion and
          storytelling over dinner, with stoves heating our backs, with
          Karolina, the second head of the tribe, Thomas and their daughter
          Frida.<br />When Andreas, Marcel and me agreed upon our hosts being
          truly generous to strangers, we were offered a sleepover (bed!!) and
          keys from their car for the following day. We humbly accepted the
          given offerings and went to sleep like babies.<br /><br />Our third
          the day has begun with the sound of the family’s cock as well as with
          both homemade yoghurt and eggs.

        />
        <p>
          Karolina advised us to scout the island Prästo we were located on,
          which is among the local prominent due to accommodating several
          historical graveyards - Jewish, Muslim and Christian ones.<br />When
          we wandered around this truly spiritual archipelago and had a
          remarkable land view of our surroundings from a nearby tower and
          cuddled with a flock of curious sheep, we returned to our temporary
          basecamp to borrow a car and wander further east, over the red roads,
          which were from time to time replaced by car ferries, to the end of
          the road on Vårdö.

          stacks of small boulders on the top of each gravestone, as a symbol of
          respect and remembrance."
        />
        <p>
          Our afternoon was in the spirit of attempts to fish in the crystal The
          clear water of an empty fishing village on the tip of Vårdö and swim
          in the October cold Archipelago sea.<br />
          <br />Despite you could count the days we have spent together on the
          fingers of a single hand, when came time for goodbye to our hosts in
          the evening, it felt like leaving a good old friend after a long time
          of not seeing each other. <br /><br />However we did not get an
          opportunity to reward the generous family, I thought that they might
          be repaying an old debt to someone else. This idea makes me think that
          if I will provide for others, my debt to the universe will be repaid
          and someone else will have a reason to treat man generously.

        />
        <p>
          Our final task was to get reach back to Mariehamn. Without any luck
          with hitchhiking, after several hours of hiking through the empty red
          roads, we reached approximately 17km distant Godby in the night and
          erected a camp tarp on the bank of lake Långsjön a few days ago.<br /><br />The
          The final day was in the spirit of reaching the final destination in
          the evening and spending the last evening in the forest between the
          city and the seashore.<br />Despite the feeling that we overcame all
          snares of fate, the final one was hiding above Mariehamn. Moderate but
          entire night-lasting rain did not give us very much sleep. Especially
          to poor Marcel, sleeping in under the bare sky just in a sleeping bag
          was one morning soaked as a sponge.<br />My semi-waterproof back bag
          protected me over most of the rain but a significant amount got inside
          as well. Andreas, who wisely built a modest tent out of his tarp, was
          probably the driest of us in the morning. <br />Unfortunately, the
          tarp tent did not cover his feet and the rain did not avoid even the
          most farsighted of us because of its large open entrance.<br /><br />
          On the final morning, we compared the level of wetness each of us had
          and said goodbye.<br />Marcel travelled back to Denmark over
          Stockholm, me and Andreas back to Turku to Finland.
