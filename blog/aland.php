            An expedition to Ã…land Islands was on my mind since my first days in
            Finland. Its time came in mid-October 2022, during the Autumn break. My
             friend from Swedish Dalarna and I have decided to take a ferry from
            the Finnish coastal town Turku (Ã…bo) in the early morning. Train
            connections from our hometown Vaasa were not matching in the early
            hours, so we had to stay in Turku overnight. We planned to sleep in
            the Alandâ€™s forest the entire upcoming week, so we decided to
            conduct our one-night stand in Turku in a similar spirit and we
            slept on the wall of the Turku castle, below the main tower. Slight
            rain in the early morning forced us to move to the port earlier than
            we planned but at least we were protected against the rain.

            As soon as the onboarding started, new issues a raised. A security 
            guard spotted my belt carrying a leatherman multitool and a larger
            outdoor knife I carry while in the wilderness. His English was
            lacking, but with Andreaseâ€™s Swedish help we were able to figure out
            he wants to perform a luggage check and take our knives during the
            cruise. Fortunately, the conflict was soon resolved we were allowed
            to board in, settle and get some more rest during the following
            four-hour travel.<br />
            For the first two or three hours, our cruise was moreover a slalom
            between hundreds of archipelagos as we were sailing through the 
            densest area of the Archipelago sea. Approximately 50 000
            archipelagos and tiny rocky islands (rarely with some green wood as
            well) are accommodated in the Archipelago sea, the area between
            Turku and Ã…land Islands. This moderate space of the size of 8300
            square kilometres is considered one of the largest by the number of
            archipelagos in the world. And it is truly an interesting scenery to
            look at.<br /><br />After onboarding from our Baltic princess in
