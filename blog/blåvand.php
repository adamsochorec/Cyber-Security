            It was the 12th of April when I woke up in the morning, grabbed my
            prepared backpack with lunch, and headed to Kolding train station. I
            took a train to the ??? where I changed to the bus heading to the
            west coast of Jutland peninsula, to the city Blåvand (blue water...).

            My original plan was to scout the local lighthouse, located
            approximately 35 minutes by walk from the bus station, out of the
            city. At that time was in Blåvand ??? held festivals and tiny main
            road cutting the city was jammed with cars, mostly from Denmark and
            Germany.<br /> I bought a bakery with shrimp salad at a local
            fisherman's shop and started walking. Town's city centre isn't the
            largest, and soon you will enter an area with dozens of summerhouses
            with gardens, separated by beautiful pines. As soon as you approach
            the seashore, the vast recreation colony turns into alone standing
            houses, in the middle of dunes, usually built a few meters from
            the sea.<br />

          Navigation states about 20 minutes of route are remaining, after
          approaching the sea shore is time to head ??south??, along the
          ??403km?? long west coast, which on the south meets the German border, and
          on the north, in Skagen, flows into the Baltic sea. The beach sound of
          waves blends with the screaming of seagulls and kids playing with old
          WWII bunkers, build by the ??Nazis?? in ?? 1945??. I soon figure out
          that the bunkers are <i>standing</i> every few hundred meters,
          probably along the entire west shore. But <i>standing</i> isn't
          probably the right term. After more than a half of century without any
          maintenance in the sand right by the sea was too much of a deal, even for
          Hitler's engineers. The majority of the bunkers simply sink into the
          sand.

            Their exterior is usually covered by graffiti and some of them
          have additional Grotesk metal construction, shaping them like a horse
          or giraffe. As I pass several bunkers, occupied with screaming
          children, climbing up on the roof, hiding in the interior and 
          former machine gun nests, I realize the point. WWII bunkers, built
          with the purpose to make killing people more efficient, with fewer losses,
          are now toys and playgrounds! The wraith spirit is gone, devaluated
          , and replaced by human creativity and the attitude of youths. It is hard to
          imagine something more embarrassing could happen to those constructions.

          As I pass more and more bunkers, each with a slightly different design
          and level of sickness, I got a funny idea to scan them. Better then
          any photo is a 3D model with detailed textures, that AR can project on
          a flat surface in a life-size. So far I have quite good experience
          with <b>Polycam</b>, scanning and processing options are not the most
          advanced ones, in many ways, it is just a black box. On the other hand,
          it is quite user-friendly and convenient to use. There are also
          several ways how to scan for free (creating user profiles, sharing
          scanned content etc.)

          I arrive at a sharp corner of the shore, where the lighthouse was built. In
          a tiny house, that probably used to serve the lighthouse's crew, I
          purchased a ticket to the top of the tower. The view feels surreal,
          the surrounding landscape looks like a planet Scarif, everywhere I look I see dunes covered by grass of blending color, crossed by narrow paths.

          Back in the souvenir shop, I observe a significant amount of amber necklaces and jewellery being offered. The older lady behind the cashier's desk explains to me that with a bit of luck I can find some of those down on the beach.<br><br>
          As I observe later when wandering along the west shore, the Danish Royal miliary likes to train in local stratified terrain and the surrounding of Blåvand is not an exception. The beach and sand fields towards the north-east accommodate several watchtowers (you can observe those on the left bottom corner of the panorama photo) and other facilities serving military purposes, such as antennas, small repositories, yellow signs announcing military areas as well as several other various models of bunkers.<br><br>Blåvand lighthouse is reachable by car, with the possibility to park nearby the sight. I would also recommend to visit nearby Bjarke Ingels's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirpitz_Museum_%28Denmark%29" target="_blank" rel="no opener no-referrer">Tripiz museum</a>.
