# Branding
"In this theme, you will be working with online branding. The starting point is an understanding of the
concept of branding and how to translate it into concrete actions online. It is important that you can
develop a creative concept and produce the visual elements that form part of a branding effort. In
this project, the focus is on web and mobile interfaces, web banners and online video.

In groups, you are to create a campaign that will brand your own multimedia agency. Since you are a
startup company, the campaign may be based on how you see yourself in one or two years. The
target audience can be potential customers, but it can also be potential investors.

Based on an analysis of the current situation, you must produce a proposal for your value
proposition, brand position and core story.

You are to develop a visual concept that will consist of 4 practical productions:
• a responsive SEO optimized web site
• 3 animated web banners
• 1 or more videos
• 1 large scale print, e.g. A poster, a roll-up or infographic

For this a communication brief and a design manual must be developed.
The hand-in consists of a synopsis, a brand analysis, a value proposition, a concept description, and
SEO-analysis."
