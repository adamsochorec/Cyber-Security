          We are excited to introduce our new product, the Tube Collector, to
          your city. The Tube Collector is a revolutionary solution for
          optimizing the recycling and can collection process.

        <h2>Product features:</h2>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              One Tube Collector can accommodate four 300 ml cans, which means
              that if two are installed in each trash bin, the capacity for cans
              would increase by 2.6 times compared to the current solution,
              which can only hold three cans. Additionally, this will free up
              space in the trash bins as people will not need to crush cans
              before throwing them away.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Tube Collector does not require any modifications to the
              current trash bins in the city, as it can be easily screwed into
              existing holes. This means that it can be implemented quickly and
              without any disruption to the current system.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              People who rely on collecting cans for income will benefit greatly
              from the Tube Collector, as they will no longer have to sift
              through garbage to find cans. Furthermore, the number of cans
              returned for recycling will increase as cans will no longer be
              crushed and devalued during trash collection.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Emptying the Tube Collector is easy and convenient. Simply place a
              plastic bag underneath and open the valve. Additionally, it will
              simplify and optimize the recycling process at the recycling
              center, as there will be no need for additional steps to separate
              cans from other trash.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The Tube Collector's design is not intrusive and will fit
              seamlessly into the urban architecture. We believe that the Tube
              Collector will be a valuable addition to your city's efforts to
              promote recycling and reduce waste.
