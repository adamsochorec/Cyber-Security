  I borrowed the concept of <i>House Hunting</i> from the inspiring photographer
  and artist
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.toddhido.com/"

  was to combine Urbex, my love of charming Scandinavian architecture, the

  the project, and Hido`s narrative style of documenting the past by capturing
  the current state or remnants of abandoned buildings.

  In the past, I tried several times to apply the inspiration I gained from
  Hiddo`s works to lonely constructions in Czechia and Denmark.

  Even though the exterior atmosphere was slightly more matching to the one that
  Hido works with - lonely lights, night, and fog often captured through long
  exposure on a medium format camera, I felt that this time I was the closest to
  Hido`s world.

  On one of my walks in the neighbourhood of Palosaari, in Finnish Vaasa, I
  couldn`t help but notice the beautiful pale green colour of a low-key,
  old-fashioned family house. Upon closer inspection, I saw broken windows and a
  damaged entrance staircase, indicating that the building was uninhabited. The
  building immediately sparked my photographer`s instinct and I saw an
  opportunity to experiment with new elements in a style I had been working
  with.

  Beforehand, I contacted the city planning department to gather information
  about the property. We discovered that the building was marked for demolition,
  so my initial plan of taking photos to be used by the
  <i>Cheap Old Houses</i> initiative to save the building was dashed. However,
  there is still hope as the Ostrobothnian Museum will likely be consulted
  before a demolition permit is issued due to the building`s age and potential
  historical value.

  and I agreed to photograph the inside of the building at sunrise on an early
  autumn morning.<br />
  We were able to explore the interior of the building and photograph the
  bleached spots on the walls, likely left by previously hanging frames and
  paintings. Despite the building`s impending demolition, we were able to
  document its beauty and history through our photography.
